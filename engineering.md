# Engineering Log

## 2026-10-05 — Build & boot baseline (`fix/build-boot`)

**Context:** Builds can't run on the dev machine. All verification runs in GitHub Codespaces: JDK 17, Postgres 16 in Docker, Android SDK 35, Gradle 8.9.

### Backend failed at startup
- **Error:** `QueryCreationException ... Attribute 'BlacklistedToken#expiry(BASIC)' is not joinable`.
- **Root cause:** Spring Data derives queries from method names. `deleteByExpiryDateBefore` was parsed as the path `expiry.date`, so Hibernate tried to join into a basic column.
- **Fix:** method names must match entity fields → `deleteByExpiryBefore`.
- **Learning:** Spring Data validates *all* derived queries at startup but fails on the *first* bad repository, which hides the rest. `findByUserIdAndIsReadFalse` / `countByUserIdAndIsReadFalse` had the same bug (field is `read`, not `isRead`) → `...ReadFalse`.
- **Verified:** `Started FinanceTrackerApplication in ~12s`.

### Android kapt failed
- **Hilt plugin missing:** `Expected @HiltAndroidApp to have a value. Did you forget to apply the Gradle Plugin?` The short form `@HiltAndroidApp class X : Application()` relies on the Hilt Gradle plugin's bytecode transform. Fix: apply `com.google.dagger.hilt.android` (Dagger bumped 2.48 → 2.51.1 as a Kotlin 2.0 / AGP 8.7 compatibility precaution).
- **`[Dagger/MissingBinding] TokenManager`:** no `@Inject` constructor or `@Provides`. Fix: `@Singleton class TokenManager @Inject constructor(@ApplicationContext context)`.
- **`[Dagger/MissingBinding] java.lang.Long`:** `NotificationViewModel` injected a bare `userId: Long`. Primitives need a qualifier + provider, and the client has no source for its user id. Removed; real-time notifications will be redesigned.
- **Verified:** `assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL (7m 49s first run). AGP auto-installed Build-Tools 34; kapt warns it falls back to Kotlin 1.9 (move to KSP later).

### Toolchain / environment
- **JDK 25 breaks both builds.** The Codespaces default JDK is 25.
  - Android: Gradle 8.9 / Kotlin 2.0 can't parse its version string (`What went wrong: 25.0.4.1`).
  - Backend: Lombok 1.18.30 doesn't run on it, so no getters/setters/builders were generated (~200 `cannot find symbol` errors). The `sun.misc.Unsafe ... terminally deprecated` warning was the giveaway that Maven was on JDK 24+.
  - **Fix:** use JDK 17 (`pom.xml` targets 17). Planned: pin the JDK in `.devcontainer`, and add a Maven enforcer rule + explicit Lombok annotation-processor config.
- **Maven wrapper:** `bash mvnw` fails (`mvnw/.mvn/wrapper/...: Not a directory`) because the script derives its base dir from `$0`. Use `bash ./mvnw`; executable bits on `mvnw`/`gradlew` are missing in git.
- **Gradle wrapper:** `gradle-wrapper.jar` is not committed (root `.gitignore` `*.jar` overrides the `!gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` exception), so `./gradlew` can't run. A downloaded Gradle 8.9 is used until this is fixed in the repo-hygiene unit.
